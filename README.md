# README FOR THIS CODE


# Running your environments 
In order to run your code locally we will be hosting our frontend on port 3000 and our backend on port 4000 as defined in our code. This is all taken care of automatically. It is good practice to have multiple terminals open when working with full stack in order to monitor both your front and backend! You can do this by clicking the little + to the right of the terminal. You will then be able to open infinite terminals and initiate both a front and back end locally on your machine with the following steps.

How To Run Frontend 

- Ensure you have CD'd into the frontend with:
  ```bash
  cd frontend/
- Run the npm command to start the project locally
   ```bash
  npm start

How To Run Backend 
  - Ensure you have CD's into the backend with: 
    ```bash
    cd backend/
  - Run the npm command to start the backend locally
      ```bash
      npn run start
*Note: If you go into the backend folder there is also a preconfigured readme from nest to give you some context of their framework*
